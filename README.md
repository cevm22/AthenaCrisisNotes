# AthenaCrisisNotes
An UNOFFICIAL Chrome extension that allows note-taking for the game Athena Crisis.

This extension is my first application of its kind. I am a novice programmer who codes as a hobby, and this small project has helped me a lot while playing AthenaCrisis


## Install

This extension is not available in the extensions store yet, so this is the only way to install it.

For now I dont know if it works in other devices than desktop web browsers.

1. **Prepare Your Extension**
   - Clone this repository and place it in any directory.

2. **Open the Extension Management Page**
   - Open Chrome or Brave browser.
   - Access the Extensions page:
     - In Chrome, type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and press Enter.
     - In Brave, type `brave://extensions/` in the address bar and press Enter.

3. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Turn on Developer Mode:
     - In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, you will see a toggle switch labeled "Developer mode". Click it to enable Developer mode.

4. **Load Your Extension**
   - Click "Load unpacked":
     - Once Developer mode is enabled, you will see additional options. Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
   - Select your extension directory:
     - A file dialog will open. Navigate to the directory where your extension files are located, select it, and click "Select Folder" (or "Open" depending on your OS).

5. **Verify Installation**
   - Enable the extension:
     - Ensure that the extension is enabled (the toggle switch next to your extension should be turned on).
   - Verify you have the extension icon: ![16x16](https://github.com/cevm22/AthenaCrisisNotes/assets/90925697/a82d895b-9e50-4c75-8bbf-a5a89df3d191)

6. **Test it**
   - Now go to https://app.athenacrisis.com/ and the extension will inject JavaScript code and a NOTES button must be appear at top of your browser screen ![image](https://github.com/cevm22/AthenaCrisisNotes/assets/90925697/02334281-f1d8-4b87-9c05-a0f7bef147b0)

  
## How It Works

The operation is simple: when the "NOTES" button appears, simply click on it to create a sidebar on the right. It uses the latest URL route to filter all notes, ensuring they are organized without mixing them up. All data is stored locally in your browser.

For hide it, just click again in NOTES button. If you move to another game and forgot to close the Notes, just close it and open it again to updates your current game notes.

Also added a 'COORDS' feature for those like me who sometimes forget where their enemy is in FOG games.

I have aimed to keep it as straightforward as possible to avoid altering the game's behavior.
